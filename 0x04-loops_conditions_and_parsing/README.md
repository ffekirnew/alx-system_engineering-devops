# ALX Project 0x04 - Loops, Conditions and Parsing

The ALX Project 0x04 is an introductory course for learning how to use loops, conditions, and parsing in a variety of programming languages. In this project, you will learn the fundamentals of using loops, conditionals, and parsing to solve real-world problems. You will create programs which utilize input data, process the data with loops and conditionals, and finally parse the data to produce meaningful output.

## Getting Started
- Setup: Download the project 0x04 starter files from https://alxproject.com/downloads and extract the contents. 
- Documentation & References: Visit the project 0x04 page on [ALX](https://alxproject.com/projects/0x04) for reference material and videos which provide further insight into loops, conditionals and parsing. 
- Take a look at the examples provided in the starter files to get familiar with the syntax. 
- Run the sample _HelloWorld.py_ file to check if Python is up & running.  

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement a basic looping examples 
- [ ] Create a program to calculate averages from user-defined list of numbers    
- [ ] Write a program to calculate sum of 2 numbers when given as strings  
- [ ] Use if-else conditions to check for vowels in a string     
- [ ] Use for loop for nested lists   
- [ ] Parse CSV Files   
- [ ] Parse JSON files
